# Interactive Campus Building Dashboard

## Project Overview

During my ArcGIS Experience Builder internship, I developed an interactive dashboard for managing and displaying detailed information about the buildings on our campus. This dashboard, built using ArcGIS, Survey123, and ArcGIS Experience Builder, aimed to streamline the information access process for various IT departments and leadership teams at the college. The main goal was to provide easy and accessible data for better decision-making, particularly in planning renovations and managing building information.

### Key Project Goals:
	•	Interactive Dashboard: Create an interactive map-based dashboard that displays building information when a user clicks on any building on the campus map.
	•	Data Collection with Survey123: Design and implement a Survey123 form to collect building data, ensuring that future users and editors can easily update and maintain the database.
	•	Dynamic Updates: Ensure that the dashboard dynamically updates whenever new data is added or modified, making it easy to manage and view building-related information for multiple departments.
	•	Modular Structure: Develop a modular, scalable system so that the addition of new building data or classes can be done easily, without requiring major changes to the dashboard.

### Project Workflow and Contributions

1. Data Collection and Survey Structure
	•	Utilized Survey123 to collect building data by designing a structured survey. The survey was created to cover key building details, including room information, building functionality, and class data.
	•	Ensured that the survey’s design was flexible, allowing future users and administrators to easily add new fields or update data without disrupting the existing structure.

2. Integration with ArcGIS Experience Builder
	•	Used ArcGIS Experience Builder to create the dashboard interface that integrates with Survey123 data.
	•	Designed a dynamic, interactive map where each building could be clicked to show detailed information such as:
	•	Building name
	•	Class usage
	•	Room specifications
	•	Relevant metadata (e.g., accessibility, electrical needs, maintenance)
	•	Ensured that the dashboard was intuitive and user-friendly, with filters and search options to help users easily navigate the information.

3. Dynamic and Modular Design
	•	Structured the dashboard to automatically update with any changes to the building data in Survey123, ensuring that IT departments and leadership always had access to the most current data.
	•	Used a modular approach, meaning that adding new building information or classes into the system wouldn’t require significant changes to the app’s structure. Updates could be managed dynamically, with real-time syncing between the survey data and the dashboard.

4. User Access & Data Utilization
	•	The application served multiple users, including IT departments and college leadership, providing them with relevant building data for strategic planning.
	•	The primary use case was for renovation planning—ensuring that leadership could make informed decisions based on current and historical building data.

**Technologies Used
**	•	ArcGIS Experience Builder: Used for building the dashboard interface and integrating the map with dynamic data.
	•	Survey123: Used to collect and structure building data with customizable forms.
	•	Arcade (JavaScript): Custom scripts for displaying the data.
	•	ArcGIS Online: For hosting and managing the data layers used in the dashboard.

**Key Features of the Dashboard
**	•	Interactive Map: Click on any building on the map to view detailed information about that building, including building class and room-specific data.
	•	Dynamic Data Updates: Any updates to building data, whether added through the Survey123 form or manually edited, automatically update the dashboard to reflect real-time information.
	•	Modular Structure: The application can easily scale, allowing new building data or modifications to be incorporated into the dashboard without downtime or manual intervention.
	•	Customizable: Future users or editors can update or expand the data without needing extensive technical knowledge, making the system highly adaptable for ongoing campus needs.

### Conclusion

The goal of this project was to create an easy-to-use, dynamic system for collecting, managing, and visualizing building-related information on campus. This dashboard not only serves the IT departments for immediate operational needs but also empowers leadership with accessible, up-to-date data for strategic planning, particularly in the area of building renovations. By utilizing Survey123 for data collection and ArcGIS Experience Builder for the interactive dashboard, the project provided a comprehensive solution for campus-wide information management.
